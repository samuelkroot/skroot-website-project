# Individual Class Project for CGT 390 - Interactive Web Applications

This project is a (low-fidelity) clone of the [Satisfactory Q&A Site](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com) to learn and grow my skills in the React framework.

API calls will be self-written in a PHP backend and hosted on Purdue servers; I will need to look into an alternative for when I graduate to maintain site functionality for portfolio purpose, but I will cross that bridge when I come to it

The site itself is hosted on [GitHub Pages]()
